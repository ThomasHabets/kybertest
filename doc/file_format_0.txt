# Encrypted data file format: Version 0 (DEPRECATED)

## Encrypted data file format

First `KYBTEST0` signifying the version 0 format.

Then the encrypted AES key. The AES key is only 32 bytes, but with
Kyber 1024 that encrypts to 1568 bytes.

Then comes the payload, encrypted with the AES key, using openssl, as
if encrypted like so:

`openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -pass pass:$(convert_to_hex $AES_KEY)`

(but obviously not with key material on the command line)

## Private key file format

Private keys are either encrypted or not. If not then it's just
`KYBPRIV0` followed by the key material, like the public keys.

For encrypted private keys the header is `KYBSECe0`, followed by the
encrypted private key. The private key is encrypted with openssl
similar to payload, described above.

`openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -pass pass:$PASSPHRASE`

(but obviously not with key material on the command line)
